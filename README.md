## What is this?

Projectify is a full-stack project management platform with a Kanban board, real-time collaboration, workspace-based multi-tenancy, and role-based permissions — similar to Jira or Linear, built from scratch.

The goal wasn't to replace existing tools. It was to make every engineering decision that goes into building one: where to store tokens, how to design the database schema, how to scope real-time events, how to handle the token refresh race condition that nobody writes about in tutorials.

---

# 🏗️ System Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="docs/images/system-architecture.png"
    alt="Projectify System Architecture"
    width="70%">
</p>

Projectify follows a feature-based architecture where the React frontend communicates with the Express backend using REST APIs and Socket.io. Business logic is isolated inside services, Redis powers distributed rate limiting, and MongoDB stores all workspace, project, task, and notification data.

---

## Features

### Backend
- **JWT Authentication** — HttpOnly cookies with dual-token system (15min access + 7day refresh). Token refresh race condition handled with a request queue
- **Google OAuth** — Passport.js with account linking for existing email/password accounts
- **Role-Based Access Control** — Per-workspace roles (owner / admin / member) enforced in middleware, not controllers
- **Multi-tenant Workspaces** — Complete data isolation between workspaces
- **Project & Epic Management** — Projects contain epics which group related tasks
- **Kanban Task Board** — Tasks with fractional position indexing for O(1) drag-and-drop reordering
- **Real-time Updates** — Socket.io with room-scoped events. Task updates reach only users viewing that board
- **Analytics Dashboard** — 7 parallel aggregation queries via Promise.all (~50ms vs ~350ms sequential)
- **Search** — Case-insensitive task search across workspace
- **Notifications** — Per-user event notifications with TTL auto-expiry after 30 days
- **Tiered Rate Limiting** — Three Redis-backed tiers: auth (10/15min), API (60/min), global (200/15min)
- **Security Stack** — Helmet, CSRF protection, NoSQL injection sanitization, HPP
- **Structured Logging** — Winston with JSON output in production, request ID tracing on every log line


### Frontend
- **Kanban Board** — Drag and drop with `@dnd-kit`, optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- **Real-time sync** — Socket.io room-based live updates without polling
- **Command palette** — Cmd+K search across projects and tasks
- **Analytics charts** — Recharts: area chart (completion trend), pie (status), bar (priority)
- **Dark mode** — System preference detection via next-themes
- **Form validation** — React Hook Form + Zod (same schemas as backend)

# 🔐 Authentication Flow

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="docs/images/authentication-flow.png"
    alt="Authentication Flow"
    width="40%">
</p>

Projectify uses a dual-token authentication system with HttpOnly cookies, Google OAuth, automatic token refresh, and request queuing to eliminate refresh race conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB Atlas account (free M0 tier works)
- Upstash Redis account (free tier works)
- Google Cloud Console project (for OAuth)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Siddhi561/Projectify
cd Projectify
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create `server/.env`:

```env
# Server
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/projectify

# Redis (use rediss:// for Upstash TLS)
REDIS_URL=rediss://default:password@your-instance.upstash.io:6379

# JWT — generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_64_char_hex_here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=different_64_char_hex_here

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Google OAuth — from console.cloud.google.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-your_secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Seed the database (optional)

Populate the database with realistic demo data for testing and development.

```bash
# Add demo data
npm run seed

# Clear existing data and reseed
npm run seed:clear
```

The seeder creates:

- 👥 4 demo users
- 🏢 2 workspaces
- 📁 4 projects
- 📌 8 epics
- ✅ ~60 tasks
- 🔔 Sample notifications

**Demo account**

```text
Email:    demo@projectify.dev
Password: Demo@1234
```

### 4. Frontend setup

```bash
cd ../client
npm install

# Install Shadcn UI components
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button input label textarea card dialog dropdown-menu \
  select avatar badge separator progress skeleton scroll-area popover \
  collapsible command tooltip
```

Create `client/.env`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`

## Key Engineering Decisions

### 1. HttpOnly Cookies instead of localStorage
localStorage can be read by any JavaScript on the page. HttpOnly cookies cannot be read by JavaScript at all — not your code, not an injected script. Token theft via XSS is eliminated at the storage layer.

### 2. Dual tokens with path-scoped refresh
The refresh token cookie has `path: '/api/auth/refresh'` — the browser only sends it on that one endpoint. Every other API call never carries the most sensitive token.

### 3. Token refresh race condition
When multiple API calls get 401 simultaneously, a request queue ensures only one refresh fires. Others wait and retry after. Without this, concurrent 401s cause logout when refresh tokens rotate.

### 4. Fractional indexing for Kanban position
Task positions are floating point numbers. Inserting between positions 1000 and 2000 yields 1500 — only one document updated per drag. Integer positions would require updating every subsequent card.

### 5. Promise.all for analytics
Seven independent database queries run simultaneously instead of sequentially. Result: ~50ms instead of ~350ms for the analytics dashboard.

### 6. Room-scoped Socket.io events
`io.emit()` sends to every connected user. Rooms send only to users viewing the relevant board. 500 users online, one task update — 10 receive it, 490 are unaffected.

### 7. Feature-based folder structure
Each feature owns its routes, controller, service, model, and schemas together. Services never touch `req` or `res` — they receive plain arguments and return plain data, making them independently testable and reusable.

## Security Measures

| Layer | Protects Against |
|-------|-----------------|
| Helmet | XSS via CSP, clickjacking, MIME sniffing |
| express-mongo-sanitize | NoSQL injection (`$gt`, `$where` operators) |
| HPP | HTTP parameter pollution |
| Custom CSRF header | Cross-site request forgery |
| SameSite=Lax cookies | CSRF on cross-site requests |
| HttpOnly cookies | XSS-based token theft |
| Redis rate limiting (3 tiers) | Brute force, credential stuffing |
| Zod validation | Malformed and malicious input |
| validateObjectId middleware | MongoDB CastError crashes |

---
---

# 🛡️ Security Middleware Pipeline

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="docs/images/security_middleware_stack.png"
    alt="Security Middleware Pipeline"
    width="50%">
</p>

Every incoming request passes through multiple middleware layers before reaching business logic. Each layer removes a specific attack vector such as XSS, CSRF, NoSQL injection, brute-force attacks, malformed input, or unauthorized access.

---
## Known Limitations

These are deliberate tradeoffs, not oversights:

| Limitation | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No MongoDB transactions on cascade delete | Project delete is not atomic across 3 collections | Wrap in `session.startTransaction()` |
| Refresh tokens not stored | Can't revoke individual sessions immediately | Store in Redis, delete to revoke |
| Regex search (no text index) | Full collection scan on every search | Add `$text` index or Atlas Search |
| No Socket.io Redis adapter | Rooms break across multiple server instances | Add `@socket.io/redis-adapter` |
| No optimistic locking on task reorder | Concurrent drags = last write wins | Add `version` field, reject stale writes |

---

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Where to get it |
|----------|-----------------|
| `PORT` | Choose any available port (default: 5000) |
| `NODE_ENV` | Set to `development` locally, `production` on server |
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB Atlas → Connect → Drivers → copy connection string |
| `REDIS_URL` | Upstash → Database → Details tab → Redis Connect URL (`rediss://`) |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` | Generate: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"` |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | Same command, different value |
| `CLIENT_URL` | Your frontend URL (`http://localhost:5173` locally) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Same as above |
| `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL` | Must match exactly what you set in Google Console |

---

## Real-time Events (Socket.io)

The server emits to scoped rooms — not broadcast.

| Room | Joined when | Events received |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| `project:{id}` | User opens a Kanban board | `task:created`, `task:updated`, `task:deleted`, `task:reordered` |
| `workspace:{id}` | User enters any workspace page | `member:joined`, `member:removed` |
| `user:{id}` | User connects (automatic) | `notification:new` |

---

# ⚡ Real-time Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="docs/images/real-time-architecture.png"
    alt="Socket.io Architecture"
    width="60%">
</p>

Every task update is scoped to Socket.io rooms. Only users currently viewing the relevant project receive updates, eliminating unnecessary broadcasts.

---

## Deployment

### Backend (Railway / Render / Fly.io)

1. Set all environment variables in the dashboard
2. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
3. Set `CLIENT_URL` to your deployed frontend URL
4. Update `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL` to your production backend URL
5. In Google Cloud Console, add the production callback URL to authorized redirect URIs

### Frontend (Vercel / Netlify)

1. Set `VITE_API_URL` to your deployed backend URL
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Output directory: `dist`

## What I'd Add Next

**Immediate** (know exactly how to build):
- MongoDB transactions for cascade deletes
- Refresh token rotation with Redis storage
- MongoDB text index for proper full-text search

**Medium term**:
- Email notifications via BullMQ queue + nodemailer
- File attachments on tasks (S3 presigned URLs)
- Task comments system with real-time updates
- Activity feed / audit log

**Longer term**:
- Socket.io Redis adapter for multi-instance support
- Elasticsearch or Atlas Search for ranked full-text search
- API versioning (`/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`)
- Integration test suite (Jest + Supertest)
